Install with newinstall.sh and eups distrib
###########################################

This page guides you through installing the LSST Science Pipelines software.
This installation method is recommended for anyone who uses or develops the Pipelines software.

If you have issues with the installation, here are two ways to get help:

- Review the :ref:`known installation issues <installation-issues>`.
- Ask a question on the `LSST Community support forum <https://community.lsst.org/c/support>`_.

.. _newinstall-prereqs:

1. Prerequisites
================

The LSST Science Pipelines are developed and tested primarily on CentOS, but can be compiled and run on macOS, Debian, Ubuntu, and other Linux distributions.
See :ref:`prereq-platforms` for information about LSST's official reference platform and build reports with other platforms, and follow the instructions under :ref:`system-prereqs` to ensure you have installed the prerequisite software for your platform.

..
  TK recommended memory, disk space, and build time.

.. _newinstall-source-dir:

2. Make an installation directory
=================================

Create a directory where you want to install the LSST Science Pipelines into.
For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir -p lsst_stack
   cd lsst_stack

If you are installing the software for multiple users (a shared stack), see :ref:`newinstall-shared-permissions`.

.. _newinstall-run:

3. Run newinstall.sh
====================

Open a new shell session for the installation (or ensure you haven't used LSST software in that shell before).
If you need to reuse a shell, see :ref:`newinstall-unset-variables`.

Next, run :command:`newinstall.sh` to set up the environment you'll install the LSST Science Pipelines into.
For most use cases we recommend downloading and running :command:`newinstall.sh` like this:

.. jinja:: default

   .. code-block:: bash

      curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsst/lsst/{{ newinstall_ref }}/scripts/newinstall.sh
      bash newinstall.sh -ct

Always execute :command:`newinstall.sh` with :command:`bash`, as shown, regardless of what shell you're in.

We recommend that you opt into the provided Miniconda Python environment (see the links below for more information).

Then load the LSST software environment into your shell:

.. TODO Use sphinx-tabs here?

.. code-block:: bash

   source loadLSST.bash # for bash
   source loadLSST.csh  # for csh
   source loadLSST.ksh  # for ksh
   source loadLSST.zsh  # for zsh

To customize the conda environment used, set the ``LSST_CONDA_ENV_NAME`` environment variable to a conda enviroment name when sourcing the file.
For other conda environments installed by LSST tools, this name will be the ``rubin-env`` metapackage version prefixed with ``lsst-scipipe-`` or the release tag files at `https://eups.lsst.codes/stack/src/tags/`_.

.. note::

   Here are ways to customize the :command:`newinstall.sh` installation for specific needs:

   - :ref:`newinstall-user-python`.
   - The recommended installation uses precompiled binary tarballs if they're available for your platform (and falls back to a source build).
     See :ref:`newinstall-binary-packages`.
     If you will be compiling and linking C++ code against this installation you'll need to ensure your compilers match the distribution's.
     **Developers should review** :ref:`newinstall-binary-compatibility`.

   For background information about :command:`newinstall.sh`, see:

   - :ref:`newinstall-background`.
   - :ref:`newinstall-miniconda`.
   - :ref:`newinstall-reference`.

   To find the ``rubin-env`` conda metapackage version appropriate for a particular science pipelines release, see :ref:`release-history`.


.. _newinstall-install:

4. Install Science Pipelines packages
=====================================

.. jinja:: default

   The LSST Science Pipelines is distributed as the ``lsst_distrib`` EUPS package.
   Install the current version, ``{{ release_eups_tag }}``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      eups distrib install -t {{ release_eups_tag }} lsst_distrib
      curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsst/shebangtron/main/shebangtron | python
      setup lsst_distrib

If prebuilt binaries are available for your platform (and you ran :command:`newinstall.sh` with the :option:`-t <newinstall.sh -t>` argument) the installation should take roughly 10 minutes.
Otherwise, the installation falls back to a source build that can take two hours, depending on the top-level package and your machine's performance.
See :ref:`newinstall-find-binaries`.

.. TK add mention of how-to for debugging binary package root issues.

The last command, :command:`setup`, activates the installed packages in your shell environment.
You'll need to run :command:`setup` in each shell session you'll use the LSST Science Pipelines in.
See :doc:`setup` for more information.

.. note::

   - |eups-tag-mono| is the current version corresponding to this documentation.
     You can install other tagged versions of the LSST Science Pipelines, though.
     See :ref:`newinstall-other-tags`.

   - If you're curious about the shebangtron, see its repository at `github.com/lsst/shebrangtron <https://github.com/lsst/shebangtron>`_.

.. _newinstall-test:

5. Test your installation (optional)
====================================

Once the LSST Science Pipelines are installed, you can verify that it works by :doc:`running a demo pipeline <demo>`.

See :doc:`demo` for instructions.

.. _newinstall-next-steps:

Next steps
==========

Now that you have a working LSST Science Pipelines installation, these topics will help you learn and do more:

- :doc:`setup`.
- :doc:`top-level-packages`.
- :doc:`package-development`.

Advanced installation topics
============================

The above steps guided you through LSST's recommended installation.
These topics provide additional information about the installation and ways to customize it:

- :ref:`newinstall-shared-permissions`.
- :ref:`newinstall-unset-variables`.
- :ref:`newinstall-background`.
- :ref:`newinstall-miniconda`.
- :ref:`newinstall-user-python`.
- :ref:`newinstall-binary-packages`.
- :ref:`newinstall-find-binaries`.
- :ref:`newinstall-binary-compatibility`.
- :ref:`newinstall-other-tags`.
- :ref:`newinstall-reference`.

.. _newinstall-shared-permissions:

Setting unix permissions for shared installations
-------------------------------------------------

You can make a single LSST Science Pipelines installation accessible to multiple users on the same machine.

First, create a separate unix group (called ``lsst``, for example) with a ``umask`` of ``002`` (all access permissions for the group and allow other users to read/execute).

Then set the ownership of the installation directory to the ``lsst`` group, have the ``SGID`` (2000) bit set, and allow group read/write/execute (mode 2775).

.. _newinstall-unset-variables:

Running newinstall.sh in an already set-up shell
------------------------------------------------

If you've run the LSST Science Pipelines previously, you may have conflicting environment variables in your shell.
To be safe, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   unset LSST_HOME EUPS_PATH LSST_DEVEL EUPS_PKGROOT REPOSITORY_PATH

Then return to the instructions step :ref:`newinstall-run`.

.. _newinstall-background:

What newinstall.sh does
-----------------------

:command:`newinstall.sh` creates a self-contained environment on your machine where you can install, run, and develop the LSST Science Pipelines.
You activate this environment in a shell by sourcing the :command:`loadLSST` script in the installation directory (see :ref:`setup-howto`).

Here is how :command:`newinstall.sh` prepares the environment:

- Identifies your operating system and compilers to determine what EUPS binary packages should be installed (the *EUPS package root,* see :ref:`newinstall-binary-packages`).
- Installs a specific version of Python, through Miniconda_, that is compatible with EUPS binary packages (see :ref:`newinstall-miniconda`).
- Installs Conda packages that the LSST Science Pipelines depend on (see :ref:`system-prereqs`).
- Installs EUPS_, the package manager used by the LSST software stack.

For information about :command:`newinstall.sh`\ â€™s arguments, see :ref:`newinstall-reference`.

.. _newinstall-miniconda:

About the Miniconda Python installed by newinstall.sh
-----------------------------------------------------

:command:`newinstall.sh` can install a dedicated Python environment for your LSST Science Pipelines installation.
This Python installation isn't required, but we recommend it.
See :ref:`newinstall-user-python` if required.

The Python environment installed by :command:`newinstall.sh` uses Miniconda_, a minimal version of Anaconda_.
It provides the version of Python that we are currently using to test and develop the Science Pipelines.

In this Miniconda environment, :command:`newinstall.sh` installs the libraries and tools needed to build and run the Science Pipelines.

This Miniconda installation won't affect your other Python installations (like the system's Python, your own Anaconda or Miniconda, or virtual environments).
The LSST Miniconda environment is only active when you source the ``loadLSST`` script installed by :command:`newinstall.sh` (see :doc:`setup`).

If you install other Python packages in a shell where the LSST Miniconda is activated (with :command:`mamba install` or :command:`conda install` or :command:`pip install`) those packages are installed into the LSST Miniconda's :file:`site-packages`, not your system's.
We recommend that you use :command:`mamba install` if possible (if the package is available from conda-forge), as it is much faster and generally more reliable than :command:`conda install`, and it avoids some potential problems with :command:`pip install`.
The Python installed by :command:`newinstall.sh` is in an isolated Python environment dedicated to LSST Science Pipelines code and your own related modules.
This pattern is useful because it reduces the risk of having Python package version incompatibilities.

.. _newinstall-user-python:

How to use your own Python with newinstall.sh
---------------------------------------------

:command:`newinstall.sh` creates a new Python environment by default (pre-configured with Python dependencies).
If necessary, you can use your own pre-existing Python environment.

To do so, run :command:`newinstall.sh` (see :ref:`newinstall-run` for details and command arguments).
When :command:`newinstall.sh` prompts you to install Miniconda, type ``no``.

Be aware of these caveats when using your own Python installation:

- You are responsible for installing Python package dependencies.
  See :ref:`system-prereqs`.

- Prebuilt binaries will not be available.
  :command:`eups distrib install` will always install from source.

.. _newinstall-binary-packages:

About EUPS tarball packages
---------------------------

EUPS distrib binary (tarball) packages significantly speed up your installation.
Rather than compiling the LSST Science Pipelines from source, EUPS tarballs are prebuilt packages made specifically for supported platforms.

Platforms are defined by four factors:

1. Operating system.
2. Compiler.
3. Miniconda_ (Python) version.
4. lsstsw_ version (Git ref).

EUPS distrib binary packages are currently being built for these platform combinations:

.. csv-table:: EUPS distrib binary flavors
   :header: "OS","Compiler","Python"

   "macOS ``osx/10.9``", "``clang-800.0.42.1``", "``miniconda3-4.2.12`` (Python 3)"
   "macOS ``osx/10.9``", "``clang-800.0.42.1``", "``miniconda3-4.2.21`` (Python 3)"
   "Redhat ``redhat/el7``", "``devtoolset-8``", "``miniconda3-4.2.21`` (Python 3)"
   "Redhat ``redhat/el7``", "``gcc-system``", "``miniconda3-4.2.12`` (Python 3)"
   "Redhat ``redhat/el7``", "``gcc-system``", "``miniconda3-4.2.21`` (Python 3)"
   "Redhat ``redhat/el6``", "``devtoolset-8``", "``miniconda3-4.2.21`` (Python 3)"

When you run :command:`newinstall.sh`, it looks at your system to identify your operating system and compiler.
The version of :command:`newinstall.sh` you run also determines the Miniconda_ version and the lsstsw_ build system versions.

Together, these four factors define the URL prefix (called an *EUPS package root*) that :command:`eups distrib install` looks for binary packages from.
If binary tarballs are unavailable for that EUPS package root, :command:`eups distrib install` automatically falls back to compiling LSST Science Pipelines packages from source.

You can see the active EUPS package roots on your system by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   eups distrib path

Here is an example of the output:

.. code-block:: text

   https://eups.lsst.codes/stack/osx/10.9/clang-800.0.42.1/miniconda3-4.2.12-7c8e67
   https://eups.lsst.codes/stack/src

Based on this example, :command:`eups distrib install` will preferentially install EUPS distrib binary packages for the macOS 10.9 system, ``clang-800.0.42.1`` compiler, and ``miniconda3-4.2.12-7c8e67`` Python and lsstsw combination.
If :command:`eups distrib install` cannot find packages at that EUPS package root it will look in the second EUPS package root (https://eups.lsst.codes/stack/src), which provides source packages.

**See also:**

- :ref:`newinstall-find-binaries`
- :ref:`newinstall-binary-compatibility`

.. _newinstall-find-binaries:

How to determine if tarball packages are available for your platform
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When you run :ref:`eups distrib install <newinstall-install>`, it will attempt to install prebuilt binary packages first and fall back to compiling the Science Pipelines if binary packages aren't available for your platform (by default).
This fallback is automatic.
You'll know packages are being compiled from source if you see compiler processes (like :command:`gcc` or :command:`clang`) load your machine.

The instructions in this section will help you diagnose *why* :command:`eups distrib install` is falling back to a source installation.

First, get your EUPS package root URLs:

.. code-block:: bash

   eups distrib path

If the only URL listed is https://eups.lsst.codes/stack/src, it means that :command:`newinstall.sh` configured your environment to not use binary packages.
Try re-running :command:`newinstall.sh` (see :ref:`newinstall-run`) with the :option:`-t <newinstall.sh -t>` argument.
Also, ensure that you accept the default Miniconda Python environment.

If :command:`eups distrib path` includes an additional URL that doesn't end with ``/src`` (for example, ``https://eups.lsst.codes/stack/osx/10.9/clang-800.0.42.1/miniconda3-4.2.12-7c8e67``), it means :command:`newinstall.sh` has configured a binary package root.
The construction of the binary package root URL is based on your OS, compilers, and Python environment (see :ref:`newinstall-binary-packages`).

:command:`eups distrib install` will only install binary packages if they exist on the binary package root.
To check this, open the binary package root URL in a web browser.
If the binary package root URL does not load in a browser it means LSST does not publish prebuilt binaries for your platform.
Either continue the installation from source or consider using the :doc:`LSST Docker images <docker>`.

If the URL does open, though, search for files with a ``.list`` extension.
A ``.list`` file is created for each release that has binary packages.
The name of the ``.list`` file matches the release tag (for example, ``w_2017_33.list``).
See :ref:`newinstall-other-tags` for more information about tags.

For example, if the binary package root is ``https://eups.lsst.codes/stack/osx/10.9/clang-800.0.42.1/miniconda3-4.2.12-7c8e67`` and you wish to install the ``w_2017_33`` tag, the file ``https://eups.lsst.codes/stack/osx/10.9/clang-800.0.42.1/miniconda3-4.2.12-7c8e67/w_2017_33.list`` must exist for a binary installation.

If the ``.list`` file does not exist for the tag you want to install, but does exist for other tags in that EUPS package root, it may be due to an issue with the LSST binary package publishing system.
You can either continue with an installation from source, consider switching to a tag that is known to have binary packages, or consider using :ref:`LSST's Docker images <docker>`.

.. _newinstall-binary-compatibility:

EUPS tarball packages and compiler compatibility
------------------------------------------------

EUPS binary tarball packages are prebuilt on LSST's continuous integration servers for a specific combination of operating system, compilers, Python, and Python dependencies.
If you are developing packages alongside this installation, you might encounter application binary interface (ABI) incompatibilities if you are using a different compiler version or a different Python environment.

In this case, the more reliable solution is to revert to a source installation.
To do this, repeat the installation but run :command:`newinstall.sh` *without* the :option:`-t <newinstall.sh -t>` argument:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash newinstall.sh -c

Without the :option:`-t <newinstall.sh -t>` argument to :command:`newinstall.sh`, :command:`eups distrib install` will always build and install packages from source, ensuring ABI compatibility.

.. _newinstall-other-tags:

Installing other releases (including daily and weekly tags)
-----------------------------------------------------------

The instructions on this page guide you through installing the current release of the LSST Science Pipelines corresponding to this documentation.
You can, however, install other releases by running :command:`eups distrib install` with a different tag.

The common types of tags are:

- **Major releases,** tagged as ``v<MAJOR>_<MINOR>`` (for example, ``v14_0``).
- **Weekly builds,** tagged as ``w_<YEAR>_<N>`` (for example, ``w_2017_33`` is the 33rd weekly build in 2017).
- **Daily builds,** tagged as ``d_<YEAR>_<MONTH>_<DAY>`` (for example, ``d_2017_09_01`` is the daily build for September 1, 2017).

There are also tags pointing to the most recent releases:

- **Current major release,** tagged as ``current``.
- **Current weekly build,** tagged as ``w_latest``.
- **Current daily build,** tagged as ``d_latest``.

You can see all available tags at https://eups.lsst.codes/stack/src/tags (each tag has a ``.list`` file).

.. note::

   Binary installations may not be available for all tags.
   From https://eups.lsst.codes/stack, browse subdirectories corresponding to your platform and look for ``.list`` files of available tags.
   :command:`eups distrib install` automatically falls back to a source build if binaries are not available.

.. warning::

   You need to ensure that the Python environment created by :command:`newinstall.sh` (see step :ref:`newinstall-run`) is compatible with the tagged software.

   For example, if you are installing a recent weekly you may need to download and run :command:`newinstall.sh` from main:

   .. code-block:: bash

      curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsst/lsst/main/scripts/newinstall.sh
      bash newinstall.sh -ct

   See https://github.com/lsst/lsst/tags for available tagged versions of :command:`newinstall.sh`.
