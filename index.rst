The LSST Science Pipelines
##########################

The LSST Science Pipelines enable optical and near-infrared astronomy in the big data era.
We are building the Science Pipelines for the `Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) <http://lsst.org>`_, but our command line task and Python API can be extended for any optical or near-infrared dataset.

The latest release is |current-release|: :doc:`learn what's new <releases/index>`.
